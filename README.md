## Resources

* [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) - join the [UCLA Codeforces Group](https://codeforces.com/group/XkrVYkI4KI/)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular free and easy to use editor, and the C++ plugin is excellent.
* [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) is a great way to get the g++ C++ compiler on your Windows computer, integrates with VS Code, and will come in handy for UCLA CS classes like 35L.
  * Alternately, on Windows you will need to install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)
* Mac setup (?)
